## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of a microcontroller to create a stopwatch application. The stopwatch can be started, paused, and reset using switches. The elapsed time is displayed on an LCD screen in the format "HH:MM:SS.m". This project is suitable for learning embedded systems programming and interfacing with hardware components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Microcontroller**: This project was developed and tested on [Microcontroller Model](#), but it can be adapted for other models as well.
- **IDE/Toolchain**: Install [IDE/Toolchain Name](#) for programming and uploading code to your microcontroller.
- **Hardware Components**: Gather the following components:
  - Microcontroller board
  - LCD display
  - Push buttons/switches
  - LED indicators
  - Connecting wires
- **Basic Electronics Knowledge**: Familiarity with microcontroller I/O pins, GPIO setup, and circuit connections will be helpful.

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the LCD display to the microcontroller's GPIO pins as per the schematic provided in [schematic.png](schematic.png).

2. Connect the push buttons/switches for controlling the stopwatch and LEDs for indicators.

3. Double-check your connections and ensure everything is properly wired before proceeding.

## Usage

1. Power on your microcontroller.

2. The LCD display will show "00:00:00.0".

3. Press Switch 1 to start the stopwatch. Press it again to reset the stopwatch.

4. Press Switch 2 to pause/resume the stopwatch.
