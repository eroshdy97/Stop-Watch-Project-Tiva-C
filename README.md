# Microcontroller Stopwatch Project

## Overview

🕒 This project implements a stopwatch application using an ARM microprocessor Tiva-C Series TM4C123GH6PM. The stopwatch is controlled through switch inputs and displayed on an LCD screen. It was developed using Code Composer Studio and created as a hands-on project for EME Egypt's Make Electronics course to demonstrate interfacing with LCD and using the timers module on the microprocessor.

## Features

🚀 Start, pause, and reset the stopwatch using physical buttons.

🕐 Display the elapsed time in the format "HH:MM:SS.m" on an LCD screen.

## Hardware Requirements

🛠️ Tiva-C Series TM4C123GH6PM microprocessor board.

🖥️ LCD display.

🔌 Connecting wires.

## Project Demo

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the LCD display to the microprocessor's GPIO pins.

2. Double-check your connections and ensure everything is properly wired before proceeding.

### Software Compilation

1. Install Code Composer Studio (IDE) for programming the microprocessor.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open the project in Code Composer Studio.

4. Compile the source code to generate the binary file.

### Upload the Code

1. Connect your microprocessor board to your computer.

2. Use Code Composer Studio to upload the compiled binary to the microprocessor.

### Power Up

1. Power on your microprocessor.

2. The LCD display will show "00:00:00.0".

## Usage

1. Press Switch 2 to start the stopwatch. Press it again to reset the stopwatch.

2. Press Switch 1 to pause/resume the stopwatch.

## Future Work

🔮 Add lap time functionality.

⏱️ Implement a countdown timer mode.
